101//Thriving in a Digital World//From mobile apps to bitmaps, this course explores computational technologies and how they impact society and our everyday lives. Topics include: social networks, creative computing, algorithms, security and digital privacy. Traditional computer programming is not a primary focus. Instead, mobile applications will be created using a novel visual programming environment.
180//Exam/Transfer Introductory Computer Programming Credit//Credit for college-level introductory programming coursework based on a satisfactory score on an approved exam (e.g., a score of 5 on the AP Computer Science A exam) or on transfer credit for an approved introductory programming course at another college. Indicates preparedness to proceed to EECS 280.
183//Elementary Programming Concepts//Fundamental concepts and skills of programming in a high-level language. Flow of control: selection, iteration, subprograms. Data structures: strings, arrays, records, lists, tables. Algorithms using selection and iteration (decision making, finding maxima/minima, searching, sorting, simulation, etc.) Good program design, structure and style are emphasized. Testing and debugging. Not intended for Engineering students (who should take ENGR 101), nor for CS majors in LSA who qualify to enter EECS 280.
198//Special Topics//Topics of current interest selected by the faculty. Lecture, seminar, or laboratory.
200//Electrical Engineering Systems Design I//Gain a systems engineering perspective of electrical engineering centered around a design competition to address a societally-relevant challenge. Apply electrical engineering concepts in circuits, computing, control, sensors, optics, power, signal processing, and wireless communications to a system such as a robot, and adapt the system to achieve competition objectives within defined engineering constraints.
201//Computer Science Pragmatics//Shells, environments, scripting, Makefiles, compilers, debugging tools, and version control.
203//Discrete Mathematics//Introduction to the mathematical foundations of computer science. Topics covered include: propositional and predicate logic, set theory, function and relations, growth of functions and asymptotic notation, introduction to algorithms, elementary combinatorics and graph theory and discrete probability theory.
